Program to take a bank CSV and generate a spending total of all the values in said CSV where the description value matches one of those passed in to the program.
Don't know if it changes depending on what bank the CSV was downloaded from, but it works for Lloyds.

Arguments in order are: location of bank CSV, location where the text file is to be generated, location of filter words (as a CSV file).

Not well error checked or particularly well written, in truth.
